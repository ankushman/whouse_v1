  * Production build: compiled successfully, all 10 routes verified

- Fixed 9 TypeScript errors in src/ files (7 remaining errors in examples/mini-services/skills/ ignored):
  * src/app/api/esg-sustainability-audit/route.ts:690 — Removed dead 'pending_verification' comparison branch (TS2367)
  * src/app/api/supplier-audit/route.ts:507 — Fixed 2 impossible approvalStatus comparisons (TS2367); changed 'in_progress' visual status to 'pending' (TS2322)
  * src/components/modules/continual-improvement-view.tsx:245 — Fixed unresolved 'BookOpen' import → changed to 'Activity' (TS2304)
  * src/components/modules/continual-improvement-view.tsx:418 — Fixed toast variant mismatch ('success' not in shadcn type) (TS2322)
  * src/components/modules/esg-sustainability-audit-view.tsx:679,802 — Replaced recharts PieChart with lucide PieChartIcon (size prop doesn't exist on recharts) (TS2322 ×2)
  * src/components/modules/supplier-audit-view.tsx:514 — Fixed toast variant type mismatch wrapper (TS2322)

LINT: 0 errors, 0 warnings (full ESLint on src/)
BUILD: compiled successfully, all routes working
TSC: 0 errors in src/ files (7 remaining in examples/mini-services/skills/ — pre-existing, non-blocking)

Stage Summary:
- BUG FIXES: 9 TypeScript errors fixed across 6 source files
- NEW MODULE: Warehouse Performance Scorecard (43 modules total, was 42)
- ~1081-line single-file React component + ~300 lines of wps-* CSS + ~268 lines of enhancement CSS
- 7 tabs + 8 chart types + score ring component + conditional formatting tables + ranking system
- Realistic mock data: 6 warehouses, score breakdowns, 12-week trends, financial/operational metrics
- Zero lint errors, zero build errors, zero TSC errors in src/

## Updated Project Status (Post Round 113)
- STATUS: STABLE + 9 TS BUG FIXES + NEW WAREHOUSE PERFORMANCE SCORECARD MODULE + BUILD PASSES (43 modules total)
- MODULES (43): All previous 42 + Warehouse Performance Scorecard (NEW — Cross-WH KPI Benchmarking, Rankings, Trend Analysis)
- API ROUTES (7): chat, inventory, shipments, warehouses, continual-improvement, esg-sustainability-audit, supplier-audit
- CSS UTILITIES: +568 lines (wps-* classes + global micro-interaction enhancements)
- Total globals.css: 19,304 lines
- LINT: 0 errors
- BUILD: compiled successfully, all routes working
- TSC: 0 errors in src/ (7 in examples/mini-services/skills/ — non-blocking)

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Dev server OOM risk in sandbox: next-server uses 22GB virtual memory (2.2GB RSS)
  — WORKAROUND: use production build with standalone server, --max-old-space-size=256
  — agent-browser cannot run alongside next-server due to combined memory exceeding ~4GB limit
- Git local/remote divergence: 66 remote commits (R57-R109) not in local branch, 5 local commits not on remote
  — Option: force push (loses remote history), pull+rebase (merge conflicts), or create new branch
- 7 pre-existing TS errors in: examples/websocket/server.ts, mini-services/realtime-service/index.ts,
  skills/image-edit/scripts/image-edit.ts, skills/stock-analysis-skill/src/analyzer.ts — none in src/
- 181+ pre-existing duplicate CSS class definitions (not introduced this round; non-blocking)
- 14 inline drawers (CI, SCAR, NCR, etc.) not extracted to shared/*-detail-drawer.tsx
- No real database integration (Prisma schema only has User/Post)
- No Supabase env vars configured (NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL not set)

PRIORITY NEXT:
  1. Build 3-Way Match Dashboard (PO ↔ GRN ↔ Invoice auto-verification)
  2. Extract 14 inline drawers to shared/*-detail-drawer.tsx (consistency refactor)
  3. Vendor contract document management module
  4. Multi-warehouse switching for dock scheduler & yard management
  5. Predictive model retraining trigger UI (link to Demand Forecasting)
  6. Resolve git local/remote divergence (force push or create new branch)
  7. Add Warehouse Performance Scorecard API route with POST/PUT/DELETE
  8. CSS audit: 19000+ classes — consolidate pre-existing duplicates
  9. Real-time WebSocket integration for live KPI telemetry
  10. Cross-module navigation improvements (related views linking)

- Git status: 3 local commits ahead of divergence point (c167f20), 66 remote commits ahead
- Attempted agent-browser QA: OOM kills prevented browser-based testing
  * Root cause: next-server uses 22GB vmem (2.2GB RSS), Chrome adds ~1GB+ renderer processes
  * Total container memory limit ~4GB — any simultaneous server+browser = OOM kill
  * Workaround: Used curl-based QA + production standalone build verification
